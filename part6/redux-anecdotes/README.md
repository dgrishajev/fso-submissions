# Anecdotes Redux App

This application expects a back-end to be running on port 3001.

## How to run

### Client

Clone the [top-level repo](https://github.com/dgrishajev/fso-submissions), go to this directory, install dependencies and start the app with:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Server

Create a `db.json` file at the app root with [this content](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fullstack-hy2020/misc/master/anecdotes.json).

And in a separate tab you need to run the json-server:

```
$ npm run server
```
